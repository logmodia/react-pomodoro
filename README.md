# REACT-POMODORO

## Goal : Code a pomodoro timer.

## Minimal requirements

* Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
* Four buttons:
  * plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
  * start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
  * reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
* At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
  * One to close the modal
  * Another to close the modal and start a new timer
